Task:
On previous attemtps, working with math has always proven to be annoying. My idea is to, instead of scanning the line for powers, then times/divided, then add/sub and calculating those, since that can cause errors when adding to a function, we turn the operands and the to-be-operated-on numbers into a function call. Heres an example:
put(1 + 2) -> put(add(1, 2))
(1 + 3) * 4 -> mul(add(1, 3), 4)

Why:
As previously stated, figuring out edge cases of what to calculate fist: the function or the addition, what if they are a parameter etc drives me up the walls. As such, now there is only one "order" in which I have to calculate: the leftmost innermost bracket is always claculated first

Approach:
Do all of this in the order of operations:
-> find the current operation
-> check if the token to the left or right is a bracket (and in the case of right also function!!!)
  -> if so, move over further until you find an opening/closing bracket
-> At this spot, set a closing/opening bracket with a corresponding function call
